# ACP adapter for the Claude Agent SDK

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40agentclientprotocol%2Fclaude-agent-acp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp)

Use [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview#branding-guidelines) from [ACP-compatible](https://agentclientprotocol.com) clients!

This tool implements an ACP agent by using the official [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview), supporting:

- Context @-mentions
- Images
- Tool calls (with permission requests)
- Compact file changes through the negotiated [AIR diff patch extension](docs/air-extensions.md#diff-patch)
- Following
- Edit review
- TODO lists
- Nested subagent transcripts
- Interactive (and background) terminals
- Custom [Slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)
- Client MCP servers
- Session-scoped long-running goals for AIR through the [goal extension](docs/air-extensions.md#goal) under `_meta.jetbrains.air.goal`
- Structured errors, recovery, and warnings through the opt-in [session failure extension](docs/air-extensions.md#session-failure)
- Concrete model and effort defaults through the opt-in [recommended config value extension](docs/air-extensions.md#recommended-config-values)
- Tool permission presentation, editable choices, and durable effects through the [permission extension](docs/air-extensions.md#permission-presentation)
- One fact per field in every tool call report, as the [ACP tool call contract](docs/air-extensions.md#tool-call-contract) defines
- All AIR extensions, capabilities, and `_meta` keys: [AIR extensions](docs/air-extensions.md)

To try changes that have landed on `main` but are not released yet, install from the
`preview` channel — every push to `main` publishes one. See
[`docs/RELEASES.md`](docs/RELEASES.md#preview-releases).

```sh
npm install @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@preview
```

### Subagent sessions

Subagents are exposed only after bilateral capability negotiation. Until the released ACP SDKs
preserve the draft `clientCapabilities.subagents` field, a supporting client may advertise
`nativeSubagentSessions` in `_meta.jetbrains.air.capabilities`; the adapter mirrors the capability
in its initialize response. The canonical field remains supported and takes precedence once it is
available. Without either client signal, Agent/Task lifecycle keeps its legacy ordinary ACP
tool-call representation and child interactions stay on the root session. Clients that use the
historical `_meta["subagent-transcript"]` capability or `forwardSubagentText` session option retain
the flattened child transcript behavior. See [AIR extensions](docs/air-extensions.md#native-subagent-sessions).
